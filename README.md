# NMODL Benchmark

This repository is created to publish channel benchmark used for comparing performance of
[NMODL Framework](https://github.com/BlueBrain/nmodl) as part of the manuscript arXiv:submit/2678839. This repository will provide :
* Collection of cells with different m-e types (including MOD files)
* Build scripts for
  * NEURON + nocmodl
  * CoreNEURON + mod2c
  * CoreNEURON + NMODL
* Benchmarking scripts based on [Caliper](https://github.com/LLNL/Caliper)
* Jupyter notebook for post-processing Caliper data and plotting
* Docker container
